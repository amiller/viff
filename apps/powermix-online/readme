How to run:
1. install flint in your machine.
2. go to solver_phase4 folder and run "python3 solver_build.py"
3. provide input file for input share and for input preconputed powers as described later.
4. run "sh runlocal.sh"





1. powermixing_online_phase1.py:
note: $n is id of the party

-Input file format:
(1). input file for input share
name:party$n-input
content:
line1: k
line2 - end : one share per line

(2).input files for input precomputed powers.
name:precomputed-party$n.share
note: here for benchmarking I used the same precomputed b for all shares. while in normal use we need to provide k such files and name format would be "precomputed_party$n_$i.share" which $i is the i-th precomputed powers.

content:
line1: field
line2: k
line3 - end: one share per line


-Output file format:

a folder created:party$n-powermixing-online-phase1-output
files in folder:
name:powermixing-online-phase1-output$i

content:
line 1: field
line 2: [a]
line 3: a-b
line 4: k
line 5 - end: [b^2][....[b^k]

2.cpp_phase2:

-this will take the output files of phase1 as input.
-Output file format:
name: powers.sum
content:
line1: field
line2: k
line3 to end: one [sum] per line

3.powermixing_online_phase3.py:
input: powers.sum$n
output:"party$n-powermixing-online-phase3-output"
content:
line 1: field
line 2: k
line 3 to end: one sum per line

4.solver:

input:"party$n-powermixing-online-phase3-output"
outputs: final mixing set. party$n-finalset.
